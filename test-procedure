* File test1 was made with random numbers that are all greater than zero (because the wilcox test gave weird errors about zero values).
* File test2 is file test1 but with 100 added to each number so that the average is guaranteed to be greater.
* To test it run: ./wilcoxTest.R test1 test2
* The script should give a return value based on whether or not test1 has an average less than test2.
